# pycompseries

This library can compare two series of outcomes and declare the winner serie with better outcome. Tricky part is, that it will declare as winner only 'clear winner' - meaning serie needs to have better outcome on vast majority of indexes, but not all of them. In another words, library is simple Stochastic-based comparator of two series - with fixed and unknown (but consistend) behaviour. It is responsibility of the client to judge its usability and backtest it with relation to its usage.
